# Period-2  
### Node.js Express and Testing with JavaScript   

*In this period you will be introduced to Express, a minimal and flexible node.js package, that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. We will also introduce the Mocha test framework together with a number of supplementing packages for assertions, mocking etc. Finally you will be introduced to a new kind of databases - NoSQL Databases, with mongoDB as the document database we are going to use  *

#### Before this lesson you should:
[Watch this key-note speech](http://expressjs.com/)

[Read about Express middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)  and/or [watch about middleware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HOem0amlyg)


**Exercises:**
* [middleware,server side rendering,sessions and REST](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Bu_FC___DM9tS8fugsLe4EnwjPs4OSYCe6PMsCVE2Y/edit?usp=sharing)

## 08-03-Thuersday
* JavaScript Testing
* JavaScript Backend Testing using Mocha
* Testing asynchronous code
* Mocking with JavaScript

### Before this lesson you should:

### Read/Watch
If you like videos, since it gives you a chance to code along in your own speed, Lynda.com have a complete Node/Express course with some cool testing videos. 
Once logged in to Lynda search for "Node.js Essential Training" and watch:
* Testing with mocha and Chai
*	Asynchronous mocha testing
*	Mocking a server with NOCK
*	Code Coverage with Istanbul

As usual, the API descriptions should be your main resource for Mocha/Chai-questions.
*	[Mocha] (http://mochajs.org/ )
* [Chai](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/#method_throw)


**Exercises:** [JavaScript Backend Testing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-QQ9lszUVLpRF8thEkNYJeXdBOpQpWGdKJ7PwgHom6A/edit?usp=sharing)

## 14-3 Wednesday
An introduction to NoSQL, MongoDB and Mongoose

#### Before this lesson you should:
I don't plan to talk about NoSQL in general, since Martin Fowler does it a lot better than me. Watch the video given below, either before or afther the lesson. It covers all "general questions" related to NoSQL

Usually I will always recommend a local database for development. Since however, we only have limited time for this topic, I suggest you create a free account on mlab.com as outlined [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/mongoose#Setting_up_the_MongoDB_database), and use this account for all exercises related to MongoDB and Mongoose.


### Read/Watch
- [Introduction to NoSQL - Martin Fowler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI_g07C_Q5I)
- [What is Mongoose](https://scotch.io/tutorials/using-mongoosejs-in-node-js-and-mongodb-applications) (one of the exercises for today)
- [MDN - mongoose tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/mongoose) (one of the exercises for today)
- [Skim my idea for a project, meant for demoes for the rest of the semester](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w0NMC89QG3oRJBLbqG-01jZsRO8IKNxEXOa3Jinwb00/edit?usp=sharing)

### Exercises
 [What is Mongoose](https://scotch.io/tutorials/using-mongoosejs-in-node-js-and-mongodb-applications)
 
 *The following is part of a larger tutorial, related to Express. Complete part 3 of this tutorial only (feel free to complete all of it, that will provide you with a great example for the exam)*
 
 [Express Tutorial Part 3: Using a Database (with Mongoose)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/mongoose#Mongoose_primer)

#### Slides

# 21-03-Wednesday
#### Before this lesson you should Read/Watch:
Skim part1-2 and read part-3 in [6 Rules of Thumb for MongoDB Schema Design](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/6-rules-of-thumb-for-mongodb-schema-design-part-1)

We will implement the mongoose models for the [mini project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w0NMC89QG3oRJBLbqG-01jZsRO8IKNxEXOa3Jinwb00/edit?usp=sharing) as a shared class exercise today:
