# Full Stack JavaScript - Spring 2018
*JavaScript is everywhere. Once a simple misunderstood language, used only for simple browser manipulations, it has now evolved along with the Web and finds itself entrenched in all modern browsers, complex Web applications, mobile apps, server-side applications, desktop applications and in emerging platforms like the Internet of Things*

This is the language we are going to "have a lot of fun with" in the coming months :-)

## How I have designed the course.
The course is divided up into 4 periods, each with a specific topic and a lot of exercises which will form the basis for the examination.
From period 2, as a supplement to the exercises, there will be an ongoing semester project which hopefully should tie most of the technologies together, and also ensure that “things” learned in one period can be used in the next.
Make sure to read the description of the semester project before day 1, since it will give you a clear idea about, what you are supposed to learn this semester.

One period will be marked as non-compulsory, which mean you can replace it with a topic decided by yourself (must be approved by me).

You will find the description for the periods on github, but typically not more than 1-2 lessons into the future since the content of this course changes each semester. The documents for each period will also include all literature, exercises, links to slides etc.

## Professional competencies
JavaScript is one of the most demanded programming skills (ref: [it.jobindex.dk](https://www.jobindex.dk/jobsoegning?q=javascript) ).

In this course you will get the necessary background to join modern full-stack teams, using JavaScript and supplementing JS-frameworks/libraries in browsers, mobile  apps, and on the server
The course also introduces geolocation (on clients and server), NoSQL, and some of the hottest newest technologies like GraphQL in order to introduce students to technologies used by full stack JavaScript projects in the real world, right now.

## Study Activities, apart from attending lessons
For most lessons, you will find a section marked "_before this lesson you should_" with articles to read, and/or videos to watch, and sometimes software you should have installed before the lesson + a _section with exercises_ which forms the background for the four compulsory hand-ins. As a minimum, _you should expect to spend the same amount of time with preparation and exercises_, as the hours assigned to lessons.

## Learning Goals
Learning goals will be given for each of the periods as *exam-questions*. This should make it very easy to see what the expected outcome is, by the end of the semester.
Given how fast things evolve in the JavaScript world, the descriptions are not complete yet. The only promise I can give is; that by the end of a period, the goals for that period will be locked, so you can start preparing for the exam.

## Preconditions for this course?
You are expected to know fundamental JavaScript, as introduced on the previous semester. You are also expected to know, again from third semester, React and React Native. If you don’t feel quite comfortable with all this right now, don’t worry. You will by the end of the semester :-)

## How to get your StudyPoints
You get (as usual) study points for attendance and "doing stuff"
Attendance:				 20 points
Period 1-4 hand-ins (20*4):	80 points
You must earn at least 80% (= 80 points) to be approved for the exam.
