# Period-4 
### GraphQL

*In this period we will introduce GraphQL, a new API standard that provides a more efficient, powerful and flexible alternative to REST. It was developed and open-sourced by Facebook and is now maintained by a large community of companies and individuals from all over the world.*

## 25-04-Wednesday
* An introduction to GraphQL
* Setting up a simple GraphQL backend with an Express Server and a Mongo Database

#### Before this lesson you should:

- Skim this tutorial [How to GraphQL]( https://www.howtographql.com/)
- Watch and CODE ALONG this GREAT [tutorial](https://www.lynda.com/GraphQL-tutorials/GraphQL-Essential-Training/614315-2.html) (this will give you allmost everything you need to design the miniproject GraphQL backend)
##### Hints for the Lynda-tutorial
- The tutorial uses two database (to really illustrate the power of GraphQL), but skip the part related to a relational database (and anything related to Aliens ;-), and focus only the parts related to MongoDB
- The tutorial includes a section related to, how you set up a local instance of MongoDB. I suggest you just stick to your mlab-acount and create a new database up here.
-- Also skip the part (4.1) that install Robo 3T, since mlab provides you with a fine enough GUI
- It seems like the authour haven't noticed that mongoose now supports promises. So when you get to the "mongoose-part" instead of doing this:
````javascript
return new Promise((resolve, object) => {
                newFriend.save((err) => {
                    if (err) reject(err)
                    else resolve(newFriend)
                })
            }) 
````
you can just do this (but the example above, one more time, nicely illustrates how you can convert a callback based design into a promise based):

````javascript 
return newFriend.save();
````
